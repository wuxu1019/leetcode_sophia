stack
1. Implement Queue using Stacks
2. Implement Stack using Queues
3. Min Stack
4. Binary Search Tree Iterator
   BST traversal/ Tree operation always uses stack.

stack
type 1. build up a stack, pop, analysis, push, then pop again
type 2. check data, and push in stack, when see some condition, pop, or push data to stack

array
1. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)

array
array contain two information, first is the data, second is the index.
remove data means, remove data and all other data behind, and their index will be changed
the complexity is O(n)
to make to be O(1), need not move data behind, a good way is move the last one to original position
