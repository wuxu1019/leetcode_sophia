1. array
   the biggest number
   the kth biggest number
2. 2D array
   spiral matrix
   Diagonal Traverse matrix
   clockwise 90
   anti clockwise 90
3. string (immutable, so change string need to create a new sting)
   KMP
   summary
   judge exsit using set, judge amount using dict

Keypoint
Determine the movement strategy for both pointers
4. Two-pointer Technique
   1> from two ends and move to the middle
   2> fast point and slow point(
      i moves one step each time
      k moves one step only if a new needed value is added
   3> slide windlow

5. Three-pointer Technique
   1> three way partition
      i, j in the front, move afterward
      n in the end, move forward
   2> partition, left is less than target, right is bigger than target

6. Hash set is used to check if
   1> here is repeat number
   2> here is cycle

   Hash map is used to store (key, value) pairs
   1> use a hash map is that we need more information rather than only the key.
   2> Another frequent scenario is to aggregate all the information by key

7. How to buildup hash map key value

   1> When the order of each element in the string/array doesn't matter,
   you can use the sorted string/array as the key.

   2> If you only care about the offset of each value,
   usually the offset from the first value, you can use the offset as the key.

   3> In a tree, you might want to directly use the TreeNode as key sometimes.
   But in most cases, the serialization of the subtree might be a better idea.

   4> In a matrix, you might want to use the row index or the column index as key.

   5> In a Sudoku, you can combine the row index and the column index to identify
   which block this element belongs to.
   (i, j)->(i*3)*3 + j/3

   6> Sometimes, in a matrix, you might want to aggregate the values in the same diagonal line.
   anti-diagonal (i, j) -> i + j
   diagonal (i, j) -> i-j
