1. directed graph to get if here is a cycle:
   1> dfs
   three state: 0 - no visit, 1 - have visited, -1 - under visiting

   2> topological sort
   get ind and outd, put all element who has 0 outd to stack
   pop each element p in  stack and count each one in intd[p] to -1
   if it is 0, put to stack
   until here is no element in stack

   3> judge if undirect graph has a cycle,
   build up mp, mp[a] = b, mp[b] = a, need to trans parent info in dfs

      judge if direct graph has a cycle
   -1, 0, 1, -1 means under visiting, 1 means has visited, 0 mean not visited
